ETL lib
====

This is the ETL lib package.  It provides an API
to munge and prepare JSON, TSV and other data using Apache Tika and
JSON parsing/loading for ETL via Apache OODT (or other libs)
into Apache Solr.  It also provides the following command-line tools:

```
repackage
    Repackages an aggregate JSON file into its constituent data files (may use Tika).
poster
    Posts a JSON doc to Solr.
repackageandpost
	Combines repackage and posting to Solr without the need for an intermediate file.
tsvtojson
    Takes an input TSV file and parses it with a set of column headers and outputs a JSON file.
translatejson
    Takes an input JSON file and a column header file and cred file and translates from source lang to dest lang using Bing's API and Apache Tika.
```

Installation
====
ETLlib can be installed with or without Tika support. Please check the relevant section below for more details.

libmagic library will need to be availabile. To test this is the check for the presence of the file command and/or the libmagic man page.

```
$ man libmagic
```

On Mac OSX, Apple has implemented their own version of the file command. However, libmagic can be installed using homebrew

```
$ brew install libmagic
```

After brew finished installing, the test for the libmagic man page should pass.



With Tika
---
For Tika support you will need to install [tika-python](https://github.com/chrismattmann/tika-python) and its dependencies first. Once you have that installed, you can install ETLlib with Tika support using the following commands:

```
git clone https://github.com/chrismattmann/etllib.git
cd etllib
python bootstrap.py
bin/buildout install with-tika
```

The `bin` directory will be populated with the various command-line tools.


Without Tika
---
To install without Tika support simply run the following commands:

```
python bootstrap.py
bin/buildout install without-tika
```

The `bin` directory will be populated with the various command-line tools.
